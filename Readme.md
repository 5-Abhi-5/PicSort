# PicSort - Face-Based Image Sorter API

**PicSort** is a FastAPI-based mini backend that takes a zipped folder of images, detects and analyzes faces using DeepFace, and returns a zipped folder of images grouped into folders by unique faces. It also detects and separates images with:

- **No faces** (in a `no_faces` folder)
- **Invalid/corrupt files** (in an `invalid` folder)

---

## Features

- Upload a zipped folder of images
- Automatically detect and group similar faces into individual folders
- Separate:
  - Images with no face
  - Corrupted or unreadable files
- Download a zipped, sorted version of your original dataset
- In-memory face matching using DeepFace + Facenet (no database required)
- CORS-enabled for frontend integration

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **FastAPI**
- **DeepFace** (with Facenet and VGG model)
- **OpenCV, shutil**
- **Uvicorn** (ASGI server)
